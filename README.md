## What is Feedbaq?
Feedbaq is a simple web application which allows you to collect and view questions
and feedback while you're presenting. It was a project for me to learn more about 
WebSocket and make something useful along the way.

## Installation
- Install MongoDB
- Run `setup.sh` for automated setup
